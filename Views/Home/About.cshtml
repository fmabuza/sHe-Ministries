        sHe Ministries was established in January 2015 by Meredith Elliott. This group is about women fellowshiping together
        and encouraging one another in the walk of faith, through all trials and tribulations of life. We study the word of
        God together and offer each other understanding through discussion. All if the sHe Ministries come from different
        backgrounds but are brought together in Christ.
